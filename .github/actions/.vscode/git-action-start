SYSTEM SETUP

- Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
Check github page (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
# installing this first avoids having permission issues with npm

- Install node
nvm install node

- Install npm
nvm install npm

- Install ncc (tool for compiling node.js modules in a single file)
npm i -g @vercel/ncc 


NOTES FOR LATER
- github/actions/.vscode/tasks.json contains the tasks that can be used to transpile the code to javascript
and to create a single file for distribution. It can be run from Terminal --> Run task
- The tasks file is almost a copy of what was created by Andrea in his own branch, I need to check if we can
have a "generic" build action, without needing to copy that for all actions
- The tsconfig.json file also probably needs to be modified
- It would be convenient to have util methods in a folder outside the action folders
